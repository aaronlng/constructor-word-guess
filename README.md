# constructor-word-guess

This is a baseball themed word guess game. It grabs a word from list.js and brings it into the game. Using constructors, the word is turned into underscores
and the user guesses letters until they run out of guesses or win the game. Words can also be phrases and the space bar is utilized as a character.
